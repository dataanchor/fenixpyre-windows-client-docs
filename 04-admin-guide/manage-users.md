# Enable or Disable Users in FenixPyre Admin Dashboard

Step-by-step guide to managing user access in the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard, including enabling and disabling users for enhanced security.


## Why it matters
Enabling or disabling users ensures that only authorized personnel can access encrypted data, maintaining compliance and security in FenixPyre environments.

### Steps to Enable or Disable a User
1. Log in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and navigate to **Users**.
2. Select the user you want to manage and click the power button.
3. Confirm the action by selecting **Yes** to disable/enable or **No** to cancel.

When a user is disabled, their access to encrypted data is revoked immediately; open files are saved and closed. Re-enabling restores access if compliance rules are met.

> **Tip:** Regularly review user access to minimize security risks.
