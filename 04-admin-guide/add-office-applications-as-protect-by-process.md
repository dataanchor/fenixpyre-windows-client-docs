## Why it matters
Configuring Protect by Process applications ensures that sensitive files opened in Office apps are automatically encrypted, bolstering data protection.

FenixPyre version 5.3.1+ supports adding Office applications and Adobe Acrobat Reader as Protect by Process (PxP) applications. First, disable them in the FenixPyre Certified Applications list.

### Disabling a FenixPyre Certified Application

1. Go to the FenixPyre admin dashboard and click **Settings > User Roles**.
2. Under **Actions**, click the three vertical dots icon for the desired user role and select **Edit**.
3. Click **Protect by Folder > Applications**.
4. Click the gear icon for the application you want to disable, then click **Disable** and confirm.
5. Repeat for all Office applications and Adobe Acrobat Reader.
