## Why it Matters
Protected folders ensure that encrypted content is only accessible in designated locations, enhancing data security and control.

Protected folders are locations where encrypted content can be consumed. Files outside these folders are not accessible.

### Managing Protected Folders in the Admin Dashboard

**Step 1:** Log into the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and select **Settings > User Roles**.

**Step 2:** Select the desired user role, click the action menu, and choose **Edit**.

**Step 3:** Go to **Protected Folders > Add a protected folder**, enter the folder path, and click Add. Note that files in this folder will auto-encrypt.
