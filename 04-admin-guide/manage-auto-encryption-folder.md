## Why it matters
Auto-encryption ensures files in specified folders are automatically encrypted, simplifying data protection for administrators.

Sign in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and navigate to Integrations > SharePoint. Here, you can view and manage auto-encryption folders.

To remove auto-encryption from a folder:
1. Select the folder name to view it.
2. Click the trash icon and confirm.

> **Note:** New files in removed folders won't be encrypted automatically.
