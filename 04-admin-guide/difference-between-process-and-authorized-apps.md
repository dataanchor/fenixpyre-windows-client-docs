Why it matters: Knowing these differences helps admins choose the right method for securing non-office workflows and controlling file access effectively.

FenixPyre by Process secures files created by specified applications, encrypting them automatically while supporting protect and ignore modes. It works in non-protected folders but not for ignored ones.

Authorized applications, including certified and admin-approved ones, allow access to encrypted files based on user roles and can only save/export in protected folders with defined extensions.
