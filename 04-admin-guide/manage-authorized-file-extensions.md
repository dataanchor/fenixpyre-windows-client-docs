## Why It Matters
Controlling authorized file extensions ensures only intended file types are encrypted, reducing risks from unauthorized formats.

**Step 1:** Log in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard, go to **Settings > User Roles > Anchor by Folder > Extensions**, and select the role to edit.

**Step 2:** Under **Authorized File Extensions**, add or remove extensions as needed.

- To remove: Click the "x" next to the extension.
- To add: Enter a new extension separated by commas and select **Update**.

> **Warning:** Changes take effect immediately and may affect file accessibility.
