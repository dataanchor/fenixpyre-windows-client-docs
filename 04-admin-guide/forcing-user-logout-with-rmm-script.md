## Why it matters
Forcing logouts helps manage certificate expirations and security issues without full reinstalls, maintaining agent integrity.

The FenixPyre desktop agent uses client certificates that expire after one year. Use this process to renew them.

**Step 1:** Contact support to obtain the PowerShell script.

**Step 2:** Run the script via your RMM tool to force logout and recreate certificates.

> **Note:** No need to uninstall the agent.
