# Managing Protected File Extensions

How to add or remove file extensions that FenixPyre encrypts and protects in the Admin Dashboard.


## Why it Matters
Controlling protected extensions ensures that only specified file types are encrypted, enhancing data security and compliance.

### Adding and Removing Protected File Extensions
FenixPyre only encrypts files with extensions defined in the Admin Dashboard.

**Step 1:** Log in to the Admin Dashboard and go to **Settings > User Roles**. Select a role and click the actions icon, then choose **Protected Extensions**.
