# Adding Protected Folders for OneDrive/SharePoint Web

How admins can manage protected folders for OneDrive and SharePoint in the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard.


## Why it matters
Protected folders ensure that files in designated locations are encrypted, preventing unauthorized access outside secure environments.

### How to Manage Protected Folders
Protected folders are locations where encrypted content can be accessed.

**Step 1:** Log in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and go to **Settings > User Roles**.

**Step 2:** Select the user role, click the action menu, and choose **Edit**.

**Step 3:** Go to **Protected Folders** and add a new folder path, e.g., `\\<SharePointURL>\sites\sitename\folder path`.

**Step 4:** Enable auto-encryption for the folder.

> **Warning:** Files outside protected folders are not accessible.
