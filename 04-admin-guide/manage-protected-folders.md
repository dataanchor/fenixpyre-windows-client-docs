## Why it matters
Protected folders in FenixPyre ensure that encrypted files are only accessible in designated locations, reducing exposure risks and maintaining data integrity.

### Managing Protected Folders
**Step 1:** Log in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and go to Settings > User Roles.

**Step 2:** Select a user role and click the action menu to edit.

**Step 3:** Navigate to Protected Folders and add a new folder path.

**Step 4:** Enter the full path (e.g., 'OneDrive - Organization\Documents') and save.

> **Note:** This applies to local drives; for web interfaces, refer to separate guides.
