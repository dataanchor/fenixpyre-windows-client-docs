# Revoke Access to Encrypted Files

How administrators can revoke access to encrypted files in FenixPyre for enhanced security.


## Why it Matters
Revoking access quickly protects data by denying unauthorized users entry, such as those disabled in the admin dashboard or violating policies.

### Revoke Access Overview
When you enable revoke access, FenixPyre automatically closes applications and blocks access to encrypted files for unauthorized users.

A user becomes unauthorized if:
- They are disabled in the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard.
- They violate access rules, like using an unauthorized network.

**Confirmation Process:** You will be prompted to confirm this action for added security.
