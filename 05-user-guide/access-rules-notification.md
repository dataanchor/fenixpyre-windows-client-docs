## Why it Matters
Access rules in FenixPyre ensure that only authorized users can access encrypted content, protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance.

Access rules are criteria that must be met to gain access to encrypted content, helping to reduce the time spent on managing access controls dynamically.

If you receive an 'Invalid Access Rules' notification, it means you are not meeting one or more required rules for accessing protected content. For example, a file might be restricted to a specific geographic area.

### List of Rules That Can Be Placed on Content

### Viewing Rules
To view a file's rules, right-click the file, navigate to the FenixPyre menu, and select 'Show Access Rules.'

Users with access can edit a file's access rules.

> **Note:** Always verify your access rules to ensure compliance and security.
