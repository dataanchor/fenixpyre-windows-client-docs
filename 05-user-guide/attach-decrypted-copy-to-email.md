Attaching a decrypted copy to email allows quick sharing but risks exposing sensitive data if not used carefully.

> **Warning:** This method creates an unprotected copy, so avoid it for sensitive information. Use secure sharing methods instead.

## Steps to Attach Decrypted Copy

### Preparation
Ensure you understand the risks before proceeding.

### Step 1: Locate the File
In File Explorer, right-click the encrypted file and select **FenixPyre > Share with FenixPyre > Attach Decrypted Copy to Email**.
