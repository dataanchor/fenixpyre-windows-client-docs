## Why it Matters
Auditing access logs for encrypted files ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance and quickly respond to potential security incidents.

Permitted users can control the available access rules for encrypted files and monitor them by checking access logs. These logs show who accessed a file, what actions were performed, and the access location.
