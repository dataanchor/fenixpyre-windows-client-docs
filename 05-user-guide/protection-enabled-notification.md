## Why it matters
This notification helps users maintain security by preventing simultaneous access to encrypted and unencrypted files, reducing breach risks.

When the "FenixPyre Protection Enabled" notification appears, it indicates the Hybrid Block feature is active. This restricts opening encrypted files if unencrypted ones are open. Close any unencrypted files to proceed.
