## Why it matters
Secure file sharing prevents unauthorized access and maintains data integrity, especially in collaborative environments like Egnyte.

Users with Egnyte Connect can share protected files natively.

### Steps to Share Files
1. In Egnyte Connect, right-click a protected file and select **Share with FenixPyre**.

3. Copy and share the secure link.

> **Warning:** To revoke access, right-click the file and select **Disable Sharing**.
