## Why it matters
Encrypting and decrypting files with FenixPyre helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance and security in file management.

### Encrypting Folders with the Desktop Agent

**Step 1:** Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder you want to encrypt.

**Step 2:** Right-click the folder and select FenixPyre > Encrypt My Data. Two options appear: "Add protection" and "Add protection and Encrypt My Files".

> **Tip:** "Add protection" encrypts the folder only, with contents encrypted automatically within about 30 minutes due to FenixPyre's auto-encryption service.

> **Warning:** "Add protection and Encrypt My Files" encrypts the folder and its contents immediately.

The same principles apply to decrypting folders.
