## Why it matters
Authorized applications ensure that only trusted tools can decrypt and display data, enforcing security policies and preventing misuse.

Authorized applications include admin-approved and certified ones that can consume plain text when access rules are met.

### Using Authorized Applications
For example, to test with a .txt file:
1. Create and save a .txt file in an encrypted folder; it will be encrypted automatically.
2. Right-click and open with an authorized app like WordPad to view plain text.
3. Attempt to open with an unauthorized app like Notepad; access will be denied.
