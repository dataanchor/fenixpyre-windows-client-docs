# Why it matters: Automatically encrypting folders ensures that all files within are protected in FenixPyre without manual intervention, reducing the risk of data breaches.

## Adding a Folder to Auto-Encryption

Follow these steps to enable auto-encryption on a folder:

1. **Access the FenixPyre dashboard or agent interface.** Navigate to the folder management section.
2. **Select the folder** you want to protect.
3. **Enable auto-encryption** option, which will apply encryption policies automatically to new files in that folder.

> **Note:** Ensure your FenixPyre Agent is installed and configured for this feature.
