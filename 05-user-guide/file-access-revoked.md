## Why it matters
Understanding file access revocation helps maintain security by ensuring only authorized users can access encrypted files, protecting sensitive data.

This guide explains the notification FenixPyre users receive when their access to a file is revoked.

> **Note:** You will learn what revocation means, how to revoke access via the FenixPyre dashboard, and how to handle it in integrations like Egnyte.

Access to files can be disabled in the FenixPyre dashboard by an administrator or user with permissions, often for reasons like employee departure.

The "File Access Revoked" notification appears if your access is disabled. If you believe this is an error, contact your administrator to regain access.

### Revoking Access to a File
Follow these steps to revoke access:

1. Open the FenixPyre dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Users tab.
3. Search for the user whose access you want to revoke.
4. Disable access by clicking the power button in the action column.

> **Warning:** If the file is open, it will close after 10-15 seconds, and future access will be revoked, but plain text content may still be visible temporarily.

### Revoking Access in Egnyte
1. Right-click the file and select Share with FenixPyre.
2. Click Enable/Disable Sharing to revoke access.
