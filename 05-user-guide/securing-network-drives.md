## Why it matters
Protecting network drives prevents unauthorized access and ensures sensitive data remains encrypted across shared environments.

Follow these steps to encrypt and secure data on network drives.

### Step 1: Encrypt the Network Share Folder on the Server
Refer to [How to Encrypt Files and Folders](../05-user-guide/encrypt-files-folders.md).

### Step 2: Configure the UNC Path in the Dashboard
Add the network folder as a protected folder in the FenixPyre admin dashboard. See [Configuring Protected Network Folders](../04-admin-guide/protected-folders.md).
