## Why it matters
Understanding approved applications and extensions helps maintain data security by limiting plain text access to trusted tools, reducing risks in FenixPyre trials.

### Approved Applications
These applications are permitted to display plain text when access rules are met:

- Microsoft Office 2016 and later (note: versions from the Microsoft app store are not supported)
- Word
- PowerPoint
- Excel
- WordPad
- Adobe Acrobat Reader
- Adobe Standard/Pro DC
- Irfanview Image Viewer (32-bit and 64-bit)

> **Note:** If an application is not listed, it cannot consume plain text to prevent unauthorized access.

### Approved File Extensions
The following file extensions can be encrypted in FenixPyre trials:

"pdf", "txt", "doc", "docx", "ppt", "pptx", "xls", "xlsx", "png", "jpeg", "jpg", "mp4", "xps", "xml", "htm", "html", "rtf", "mhtml", "csv", "xlsm", "xlsb", "gif", "tif", "bmp", "wmf", "svg", "pps"

> **Warning:** Attempting to encrypt unsupported extensions may result in errors or inaccessibility.
