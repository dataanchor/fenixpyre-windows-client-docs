# Sharing Files Using FenixPyre Right-Click Menu

How to securely share encrypted files and folders via the right-click menu in File Explorer.


## Why it matters
Right-click sharing simplifies secure file collaboration, ensuring encrypted content is shared efficiently while maintaining data protection.

### Sharing Protected Files
**Step 1:** In File Explorer, right-click an encrypted folder or file, then select **FenixPyre > Share with FenixPyre > Share (Protected)**.

> **Note:** Only one folder at a time; limit is 50 files maximum, and each file must be under 50 MB.

If a file exceeds the size limit, you'll see an error message.

**Step 2:** Enter a link name, recipient emails, and set an expiry date.

> **Tip:** Use "Add Files" to include more files or "Remove Files" to exclude them. The default expiry is 60 days.
