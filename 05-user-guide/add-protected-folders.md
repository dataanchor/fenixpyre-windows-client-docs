# Add Protected Folders in a Distributed File System Environment

Guide to adding and managing protected (encrypted) folders in DFS, UNC, or mapped drive setups for enhanced security.


## Why it Matters
Protecting folders in a distributed file system ensures data encryption across multiple paths, maintaining security in shared environments.

Distributed File System (DFS) allows seamless file access via various paths. FenixPyre enables encrypting folders for use with UNC, DFS, or mapped drives.

### How to Add a Protected Folder
1. Navigate to the folder you want to protect.
2. Right-click the folder and select **FenixPyre > Encrypt My Data > Add Protection**.

After these steps, access your encrypted folder via DFS, UNC, or mapped drives.

> **Warning:** Ensure all paths are correctly configured to avoid access issues.
