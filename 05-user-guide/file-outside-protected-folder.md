## Why it matters
Notifications for files outside protected folders help prevent unauthorized access and ensure encrypted files remain secure within designated areas.

### Protected Folders
Protected folders are specific locations in your organization where encrypted content can be safely accessed. If a file is outside these folders, it becomes inaccessible to maintain security.

The "File Out of Protected Folder" notification indicates that an encrypted file has been moved from a protected folder, making it non-consumable. To access the file again, move it back to a protected folder.
