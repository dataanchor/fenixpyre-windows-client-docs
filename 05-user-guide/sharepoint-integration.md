## Why it matters
Effective SharePoint integration ensures secure file sharing and access control, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized exposure.

### Managing Shared Links

**Step 1:** Sign in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard and navigate to **Sharing**. The Shared Links section displays all folders and files shared via SharePoint or OneDrive.

Select the settings icon in the rightmost column next to the desired folder. A new window appears where you can disable/enable the link, copy it, or view recipients.

- **Disable link:** Prevents access for all previously shared users.
- **Enable link:** Restores access for shared users.
- To view recipients, select the dropdown arrow in the Recipients row.
