# Encryption Success Notification

Understand notifications received after encrypting files with FenixPyre.


## Why it matters
Notifications confirm that files are securely encrypted, helping users verify protection and manage access rules effectively.

This article explains the notification FenixPyre users receive when they encrypt a file.

A user can encrypt a file. The "Files Successfully Encrypted" alert means your file is now protected using AES 256 encryption.

Encrypted files will have default access rules. If these rules aren't met, users won't access the plain text.

**Viewing a File's Access Rules**
1. Right-click the file.
2. Select **FenixPyre > Show Access Rules**.

A user can also decrypt a file, but this action is logged.

> **Warning:** FenixPyre cannot control decrypted files.
