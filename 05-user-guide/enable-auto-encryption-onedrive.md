## Why it matters
Auto-encryption protects files in OneDrive by automatically encrypting them, ensuring data security during sharing and collaboration.

Users must have a valid FenixPyre account. To add users, refer to [Invite Team](/03-setup-&-installation/invite-team).

### Steps to Enable Auto-Encryption for a Folder in OneDrive

1. Right-click the folder in OneDrive.
2. Select "FenixPyre" and choose "Add to Auto-Encryption".
   - This will automatically encrypt files added to the folder via SharePoint or OneDrive apps.
   - **Note:** Existing unencrypted files in the folder will remain unencrypted.
