## Why it matters
Understanding this notification helps FenixPyre users quickly identify when file restoration is not possible, ensuring efficient data management and reducing downtime.

FenixPyre retains logs of changes made to encrypted files. You can restore a file to a previous version by right-clicking it, selecting "FenixPyre," and choosing "Restore to Previous Version."

If no changes have been made or no previous version exists, the following notification appears:

<!-- IMG: ./media/09-troubleshooting-&-faq/no-version-notification.png | Alt: Notification for no previous file version -->

> **Note:** This occurs because the file has not been modified since it was last encrypted.
