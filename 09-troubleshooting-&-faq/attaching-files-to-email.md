## Why it matters
Understanding file attachment errors prevents data loss and ensures smooth encrypted file handling in email workflows.

### Common Causes and Solutions

Users may encounter issues attaching files if access rules are not followed or if the file is in use.

**Step 1:** If you receive an error, check if the file is open and close it if necessary.

**Step 2:** Verify the file's access rules by right-clicking the file, selecting 'FenixPyre', and choosing 'Show Access Rules'.
