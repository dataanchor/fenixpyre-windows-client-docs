## Why it matters
Understanding the Save-As Block notification prevents accidental exposure of encrypted files and ensures data security by maintaining separation between protected and non-protected areas.

This guide explains the Save-As Block notification that FenixPyre users may encounter, which occurs when trying to save an encrypted file into a non-protected folder.

> **Note:** FenixPyre's hybrid blocking feature ensures that encrypted and plain text content do not mix, enhancing data protection.

The notification appears for one of two reasons, but this article focuses on saving an encrypted file to a non-protected folder. FenixPyre prevents this to keep your files secure.

If you see this notification, save the file to a protected folder or enable encryption on the target folder.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the folder:** Check if the destination folder is protected in FenixPyre.
2. **Move or protect the folder:** 
   - Save the file to an existing protected folder.
   - Or, add protection to the non-protected folder via the FenixPyre dashboard.
