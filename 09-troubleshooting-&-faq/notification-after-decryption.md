# Notifications After File Decryption

Understand the notifications users receive when decrypting files in FenixPyre, ensuring awareness of data security implications.


## Why it matters
This notification alerts users that a decrypted file is now unprotected, helping prevent unintended data exposure during collaboration.

### Understanding Decryption Notifications
When a user decrypts a file, they receive a "Files Successfully Decrypted" alert, indicating the file is now in plain text and accessible without restrictions.

> **Note:** Decrypted files are logged for auditing, but FenixPyre cannot control them afterward.
