## Why it matters
This notification prevents accidental data loss by alerting users when no prior versions of an encrypted file exist.

FenixPyre tracks changes to encrypted files, allowing restoration to previous versions via right-click options. If no changes have been made, the "No Previous Version to Restore" alert appears.

- Right-click the file, select "FenixPyre," and choose "Restore to Previous Version."

- If the alert appears, it means no prior versions are available:
