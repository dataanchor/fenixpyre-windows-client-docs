# Handling 'Process in Progress' Notification in FenixPyre

Learn how to manage the notification for ongoing encrypting or decrypting processes in FenixPyre.


## Why it matters
This notification helps prevent conflicts during large-scale encrypting or decrypting operations, ensuring data integrity and process completion.

The "Another instance of encrypting or decrypting is currently in progress" notification appears when a batch of files is being processed. Attempting another operation during this time triggers it.

Monitor the progress window in the bottom right of your screen. Wait for it to complete before starting new operations.
