## Why it matters
The updates in FenixPyre 5.0.0 enhance usability, security, and collaboration, helping users protect sensitive data more effectively in various scenarios.

We are excited to introduce several new features and improvements in FenixPyre version 5.0.0 and later.

### Airplane Mode

FenixPyre users can now access encrypted content offline. This feature is essential for productivity in environments without internet access.

- Mark a protected folder for offline access.
- Allow FenixPyre to sync with cloud services.
- Work with your encrypted data seamlessly.
- Upon reconnection, FenixPyre syncs access logs and keys for new data.

### Encryption by Process

Create data control policies that integrate with your tools to ensure files are encrypted automatically.

### Co-editing Mode for SharePoint/OneDrive

Encrypted files on SharePoint or OneDrive are no longer read-only. Now, owners and collaborators can edit simultaneously.

### Sharing from SharePoint

Encrypt and share files from SharePoint securely, with full control to revoke access at any time.

### Audit Logs for Files

As a file owner, view detailed records of file access, including who accessed it, when, actions taken, and geolocation data.
