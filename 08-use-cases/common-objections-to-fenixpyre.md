## Why it matters
Understanding these objections helps organizations make informed decisions about adopting FenixPyre for robust, persistent data protection beyond traditional tools.

### Common Objections and Responses
FenixPyre addresses various concerns by embedding encryption directly into data, ensuring protection even outside your environment.

- **Existing Encryption:** While device or storage encryption is useful, it fails when data leaves your organization. FenixPyre maintains control through forensic logging and access revocation.
- **MFA or MDM:** These protect access but not data in transit. FenixPyre encrypts data at rest and in motion.
- **Ransomware Protection:** FenixPyre prevents exfiltration of encrypted files, complementing backup strategies.

> **Tip:** For detailed comparisons, consult your security team.
