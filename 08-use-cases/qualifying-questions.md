- How are you currently handling file protection?
- How do you currently share sensitive files?
- Are you concerned with AI tools like Co-Pilot and data indexing?
- Do you consider your security posture proactive enough?
- Are exiting employees leaving with sensitive data a concern?
- Around how many employees work with sensitive files, and how many groups?
- How are you logging access to sensitive files?
