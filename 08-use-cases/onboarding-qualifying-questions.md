## Why it matters
These questions help identify gaps in current file protection strategies, ensuring a seamless transition to FenixPyre.

Consider asking these key questions in your first meeting:

1. How are you currently handling file protection?
2. How do you share sensitive files?
3. What issues do you want FenixPyre to solve?
4. What types of files contain your sensitive information (e.g., spreadsheets, CAD files)?
5. Approximately how many employees work with sensitive files, and how many groups are involved?
6. How do you log access to sensitive files?
7. Which cloud storage platforms do you use (e.g., SharePoint)?
8. What operating systems are typically used for sensitive files?
9. What is your timeline for adopting a secure file protection platform?
