## Why it matters
Understanding these objections helps organizations choose FenixPyre as a superior alternative to traditional DLP for better data security and collaboration.

### We Already Have DLP (e.g., MIP, AIP)

Traditional DLP solutions have limitations:

- They can be overly restrictive, leading to poor user experiences and workarounds.
- Data remains unencrypted, risking exposure during breaches.
- They focus on containment, hindering sharing.

FenixPyre addresses these by:

- Being lightweight and user-friendly.
- Always encrypting files for protection.
- Supporting secure collaboration within access rules.
