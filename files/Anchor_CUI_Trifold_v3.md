# Zero Trust Data Centric Security

Learn how FenixPyre simplifies end-to-end encrypted CUI for compliance and secure collaboration, minimizing attack surfaces and windows.


## Why it Matters
FenixPyre empowers organizations to maintain absolute control over their valuable data, ensuring secure sharing without the fear of loss or abuse, which is crucial for compliance and hybrid work environments.

### Our Vision
Information, as valuable property, allows its owners to benefit from it while retaining full control, maximizing security and minimizing risks.

### Our Mission
To enable organizations to share information affordably and easily for business needs, without the risk of it being lost, stolen, or misused.

### Extreme Multi-Factor and Instant Revocation
FenixPyre takes zero-trust authorization further with patented heartbeat technology, continuously verifying access rules in real-time based on sources like Active Directory or IP ranges. If a rule is violated, access is instantly revoked, even during file use, ensuring trust is never assumed.

### Compliance, Ransomware Protection, and Hybrid Work
FenixPyre addresses key challenges:
- **CMMC Compliance Made Easy:** It solves difficult CMMC practices for Department of Defense contractors by encrypting data, allowing business continuity without disruptions.
- **Protection Against Doxware:** Your sensitive data remains encrypted, neutralizing threats even if data is stolen, as decryption keys are secured offsite.

### FenixPyre Controlled Files
- **Persistent and Transparent Encryption:** Ensures data security for all types, including CAD, voice, video, and office files.
- **Continuous Multi-Factor Access Controls:** Enforces encryption controls even outside networks, devices, and cloud applications.
