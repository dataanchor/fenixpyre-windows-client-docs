# FenixPyre vs. DLP: Rethinking Data Protection

Discover why traditional DLP fails and how FenixPyre's self-protecting data approach offers a simpler, more effective alternative for securing sensitive information.


# FenixPyre vs. DLP

**Why it matters:** In an era of frequent cyber attacks, self-protecting data empowers organizations to safeguard files directly, reducing breach risks without complex DLP implementations that often fail.

## Introduction
Data protection is critical as attack surfaces expand, but DLP strategies fall short for many applications, focusing on networks rather than data itself. More than 35% of large DLP implementations fail due to complexity and the inability to protect data once it's moved or shared.

FenixPyre flips this by encrypting files invisibly, allowing secure collaboration without workflow changes.

## Self-Protecting Data Advantages
1. **Fast Implementation:** Deploy in minutes without integrations or monitoring.
2. **Transparent to Users:** Protection is seamless, like antivirus, preserving user experience.
3. **Data Protected in All States:** Files are encrypted at rest, in transit, and in use, with continuous access controls.
4. **Affordable:** Costs a fraction of DLP, with minimal setup and no ongoing training.

> **Warning:** DLP's focus on locking down people and devices leaves data vulnerable once it leaves controlled environments.

## How FenixPyre Fixes DLP Weaknesses
- **Implementation Speed:** Unlike DLP's months-long setup, FenixPyre enables quick protection.
- **Access Controls:** Revoke access instantly if employees leave, rendering files worthless.
- **Risk Reduction:** Addresses insider threats, negligence, and external attacks effectively.

## Conclusion
FenixPyre makes data protection straightforward, ensuring files remain secure everywhere.
