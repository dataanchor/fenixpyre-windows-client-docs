# Achieving Effortless CMMC Compliance with FenixPyre

## Why it Matters
Protecting sensitive data is essential for businesses working with the federal government, as non-compliance can lead to lost contracts and security risks.

FenixPyre Zero Trust Data Security helps organizations like Emersion Design, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based architectural firm, uphold high-level security postures while meeting federal cybersecurity requirements.

Emersion Design provides professional services in architecture, structural engineering, and sustainability consulting, with the federal government as its largest customer.

### The Challenge
Since November 2020, organizations bidding on Department of Defense contracts must achieve Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) compliance. For Emersion Design, this meant enhancing data security for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), which includes sensitive data often shared and moved.

"CMMC compliance required us to change the way we secured our data and files, and to do a lot more than the measures already taken for NIST 800-171 compliance," explained Bryant Cherry, IT Administrator at Emersion Design. "We needed a zero trust tool that would encrypt our files in place no matter where they are."

### The Solution
Emersion Design selected FenixPyre for its simple, transparent, bulletproof, and affordable CMMC data protection.

"It wasn’t difficult to see that FenixPyre was the right solution. During our demo, I found it to be lightweight and very easy to use as well as able to get the job done…offered at a price point that made it a cost-effective way to meet our CMMC requirements," said Cherry.

FenixPyre uses military-grade FIPS-validated encryption, combined with multifactor access controls and a digital chain of custody via forensic logging. It embeds zero trust data-centric security into files without changing how users work with or share them.

If files are stolen, they appear as nothing more than ciphertext. FenixPyre is also invisible and won’t disrupt business processes or employees.

"FenixPyre is exactly what we needed," said Cherry. "We have about 5,000 files that are encrypted in place right now, and we expect that number to grow."

### The Outcomes
FenixPyre supports any application and is easily configurable for industry-specific needs. For Emersion Design, it covers applications like AutoCAD, Revit, and Bluebeam, ensuring protection for confidential data.

Installation took under five minutes per workstation, with a small learning curve. Users see a blue icon indicating an encrypted file.

Support from FenixPyre has been exceptional, with responsive assistance and continuous improvements.

"The federal government isn’t going to work with us if we don’t meet CMMC compliance. FenixPyre has not only helped us achieve compliance but also elevated our cybersecurity without adding complexity," said Cherry.
