**Why it matters:** Protecting healthcare data through encryption prevents unauthorized access, safeguarding patient privacy and reducing the financial and reputational risks from data breaches.

## Overview
FenixPyre encrypts sensitive files, ensuring that protected health information (PHI) remains secure even if files are shared or stolen. Traditional controls like firewalls, mobile device management (MDM), and data loss prevention (DLP) often fail because they focus on networks and devices rather than the data itself.

### Key Benefits
- **Neutralize Breach Risks:** FenixPyre bakes an invisible layer of encryption into files, making them unusable to unauthorized users.
- **Easy Deployment:** As a SaaS solution, it integrates with existing apps and infrastructure without requiring IT changes.
- **Invisible Protection:** Users experience no disruptions, similar to antivirus software, allowing seamless workflows.

> **Note:** FenixPyre supports full logging of file accesses, enabling secure sharing with external organizations.
