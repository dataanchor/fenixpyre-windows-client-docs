# FenixPyre CMMC 2.0 Security Architecture

A simple architecture using FenixPyre to achieve CMMC 2.0 compliance by encrypting data and reducing system boundaries.


# FenixPyre CMMC 2.0 Security Architecture

**Why it matters:** CMMC certification is essential for defense contractors, and FenixPyre simplifies compliance by encrypting data end-to-end, reducing costs and effort.

## Introduction
CMMC 2.0 requires protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). FenixPyre helps by limiting system boundaries and enforcing encryption.

### What is CMMC 2.0?
It mandates levels of cybersecurity for DoD suppliers, built on NIST 800-171.

## Security Architecture
FenixPyre reduces the system to encrypted files on authorized devices, independent of IT infrastructure.

### High-Level Architecture
- Encrypts CUI with FIPS-validated cryptography.
- Enforces access via multi-factor controls and logs.

## Examples of IT Infrastructures
- Internal file servers for manufacturing.
- Remote access for hybrid workforces.
- Hybrid clouds with end-to-end encryption.

## CMMC Mapping
FenixPyre covers practices like access control (AC), audit logging (AU), and data protection (SC), with shared or customer responsibilities for others.

> **Warning:** Ensure all devices are managed to maintain compliance.

## Conclusion
This architecture lowers certification costs by focusing on secure data handling.
