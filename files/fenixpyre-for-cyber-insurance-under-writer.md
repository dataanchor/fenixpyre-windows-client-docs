# FenixPyre for Cyber Insurance

Discover how FenixPyre enhances cyber insurance by neutralizing data breach risks through advanced encryption and multi-factor authentication (120 chars).


## Why It Matters
FenixPyre eliminates data loss liabilities from network breaches, making cyber insurance more accessible and cost-effective by rendering stolen data useless.

### Beyond Classical MFA
Classical multi-factor authentication addresses only 32% of data breach risks from hacked accounts. FenixPyre goes further by encrypting files and enforcing access controls on every access, tackling the remaining 68%.

### Neutralizing Breach Liabilities
With FenixPyre, even if data is stolen, it remains encrypted and inaccessible without proper authorization, removing the need for breach notifications, identity recovery, or data restoration.

> **Warning:** Network breaches are inevitable, but data losses don't have to beâ€”FenixPyre ensures files are always protected.

### How It Works
1. Encrypt sensitive files to integrate multi-factor authentication on all accesses.
2. Files remain secured even when removed from the organization.

### Benefits for Cyber Insurance
- Mitigates risks, making policies easier to obtain.
- No changes to workflows; deploys seamlessly into existing infrastructure.
