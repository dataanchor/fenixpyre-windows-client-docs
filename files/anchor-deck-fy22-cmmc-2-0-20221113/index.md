# FenixPyre Overview and CMMC 2.0

## Why it Matters
FenixPyre empowers organizations to secure sensitive data affordably, reducing risks and compliance burdens in regulated industries like defense.

FenixPyre is based in Columbus, Ohio, founded in 2019 from Ohio State University research. It serves sectors like DoD, banking, and manufacturing, focusing on data security without disrupting workflows.

### End-to-End Encrypted Data
FenixPyre provides self-protecting encryption for controlled unclassified information (CUI), allowing secure sharing across networks and clouds.

> **Warning:** Ensure data is encrypted before sharing to maintain compliance with DFARS and ITAR.

FenixPyre inverts traditional security by embedding protection into files, combining encryption, access controls, and logging.

### Key Features
- **Zero Trust Data-Centric Security:** Minimizes attack surfaces and windows.
- **Simplifying CMMC:** Reduces complexity, audit scope, and incident response efforts.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Choose locations to encrypt.
2. Select users with access.
3. Define access methods.

### Technologies
- Persistent and Transparent Encryption: FIPS-validated, per-file security.
- Continuous Multi-Factor Access Controls: Real-time verification.
- Digital Chain of Custody: Forensic logging for audits.
