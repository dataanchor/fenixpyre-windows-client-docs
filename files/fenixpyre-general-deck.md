## Why It Matters
FenixPyre simplifies data security, ensuring your organization's sensitive files remain protected against theft and breaches, enabling seamless collaboration without compromising control.

### Who Are We?
FenixPyre is based in Columbus, Ohio, founded in 2019 from years of R&D at The Ohio State University. It serves customers in US DoD, Banking, Insurance, Finance, Municipalities, Manufacturing, Private Equity, and Retail. The mission is to empower organizations to use and share information confidently, preventing loss, theft, or abuse.

### FenixPyre's Approach to Data Security
FenixPyre is a zero-trust file security platform that provides complete ownership and control to prevent data theft while maintaining user transparency and simplicity.

> **Note:** Traditional IT controls like DLP focus on networks and devices but fail in key areas.

1. They only support some file types, not all.
2. Protection ends once files are moved, shared, or stolen.
3. These controls frustrate users, leading to workarounds or reduced security.

FenixPyre bakes protection into the data itself, making it invisible to users like antivirus software. This ensures files are protected wherever they go.

### Key Features
FenixPyre combines encrypting files with continuous multi-factor access controls and a digital chain of custody for forensic logging and access revocation.

#### Simple Deployment
1. Choose the locations to encrypt.
2. Pick who gets access.
3. Select how it can be accessed.

This implements zero-trust data-centric security, minimizing attack surfaces and windows.

### Technical Components
- **Persistent Transparent Encrypting:** Files are independently encrypted using FIPS-validated methods, remaining protected at rest, in transit, and in use. Security travels with the data, limiting damage to individual files.
- **Continuous Multi-Factor Access Controls:** Patented technology verifies access rules in real-time using sources like Active Directory. Access is revoked instantly if rules are broken, even during use.
- **Chain of Custody:** Real-time forensic logging tracks every access, providing audit trails and physical location data.

### Ecosystem and Pricing
FenixPyre works with most data stores, applications, and platforms, including file servers, local drives, and IoT devices.

Pricing starts at $16/seat/month, with the platform including up to 25 users for $4,800 annually under a 3-year commitment.
