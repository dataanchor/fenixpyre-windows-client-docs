## Why it matters
FenixPyre's DLP features block unauthorized sharing or exporting of protected data, minimizing risks in common business applications.

FenixPyre actively protects content in applications like Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Visio, and Adobe Reader by disabling features such as sharing, exporting, transforming, and printing.

### How It Works
1. Open a protected file in a supported application.
2. Access the 'File' tab to see restricted options.

> **Note:** In Agent version 6.0.0, the 'Share' tab in Word may not be fully restricted.

### Enabling/Disabling DLP Features
1. Log in to the FenixPyre Admin Dashboard.
2. Go to the User Roles tab and edit the desired role.
3. Under MS Office Add-In Settings, enable or disable DLP protection.
4. Save the changes.
