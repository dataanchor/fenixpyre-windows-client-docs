## Why it matters
Protecting source code with FenixPyre ensures persistent encryption at rest and in use, maintaining security without impacting development tools.

FenixPyre encrypts source code throughout its journey, from repository to endpoint. Admins must add development applications as authorized for access.

> **Note:** See [Authorized Applications](/04-admin-guide/authorized-applications) for setup details.
