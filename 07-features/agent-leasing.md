# Agent Leasing for Collaboration

Overview of leasing the FenixPyre Agent for secure inter-organizational collaboration.


## Why it Matters
Agent leasing enables secure data sharing between organizations while maintaining full control, ensuring compliance and trust in collaborations.

Agent leasing allows an existing FenixPyre customer to enable a third party to download the FenixPyre Agent using their Organization ID.

This is used for collaboration where one organization has FenixPyre implemented, and the other does not, allowing the first to retain control.

The organization with the ID is billed for all licenses.

**Steps to Start Leasing:**

**Step 1:** Share the FenixPyre Agent and your Organization ID.

**Step 2:** Whitelist approved email domains.

**Step 3:** Create new third-party user roles, add protected folders, configure right-click permissions, manage approved applications, and authorized file extensions.

**Step 4:** Add users to a user role and disable access when no longer needed.
