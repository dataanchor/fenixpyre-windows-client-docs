**Why it matters:** Auto-encryption ensures files are automatically encrypted upon upload or modification, streamlining security without manual intervention and reducing human error.

### How to Add an Auto-Encryption Folder
Navigate to the desired folder, right-click, and select "Add to FenixPyre Auto-Encryption." Files uploaded to this folder will automatically encrypt.
