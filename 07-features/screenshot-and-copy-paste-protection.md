# Why it matters

Screenshot and copy-paste protection prevents users from capturing or extracting sensitive encrypted data, enhancing overall security in collaborative environments.

## Enabling Screenshot and Copy-Paste Protection

This feature disables copy-paste operations across your system and blocks default Windows screenshot tools when an encrypted file is open. Note that third-party tools may bypass this, so it's best used with other security measures.

> **Warning:** Only users with appropriate roles can enable or disable this feature.
