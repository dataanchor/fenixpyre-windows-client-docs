# Opening a FenixPyre Shared Link from OneDrive/SharePoint

Guide for recipients to securely open and access encrypted files shared via FenixPyre from OneDrive or SharePoint, ensuring data protection during collaboration.


## Why it matters
Securely opening shared encrypted links protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, maintaining compliance and trust in collaborative environments.

### Receiving and Opening the Shared Link
When a encrypted file or folder is shared, you'll receive an email notification.

**Step 1:** In the email, select **Open file** to begin accessing the content.

**Step 3:** Check your email for a one-time passcode. Enter the 6-digit code and select **Login**.

> **Note:** The code expires after 15 minutes. If it has expired, restart by selecting "Open File" in the original email to get a new code.

> **Warning:** The access token lasts 3 hours. Reauthenticate afterward for continued access.
