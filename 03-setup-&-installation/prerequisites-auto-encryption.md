## Why it matters
Proper prerequisites ensure that auto-encryption is implemented efficiently, preventing issues like storage overload and maintaining system performance.

### Prerequisites for Auto-Encryption
Before enabling auto-encryption on a folder, consider the following:

#### Storage Space
Ensure sufficient storage is available, as encrypting files may increase usage due to new versions.

#### User Permissions
Only admins can enable auto-encryption on folders to maintain control and security.

#### Tenant Limits
Be aware of throttling limits; for folders with more than 100,000 files, wait 24 hours to avoid resource issues.

#### Additional Considerations
For very large datasets (over 500,000 files), contact support to allocate resources and handle potential new data issues.
