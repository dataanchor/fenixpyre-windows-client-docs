This guide demonstrates how to onboard a new client from first interaction to completion.

### Pre-Deployment
1. Collaborate with the client to complete FenixPyre's onboarding form.
2. Ensure all minimum system requirements are met.
3. Schedule a deployment session, allowing at least 72 hours after form submission.

### Deployment - GUI Install
1. Have the recipient accept the invitation and create dashboard credentials.
2. Sign into the dashboard and select Installers.
3. Download and unzip the desired agent version.
4. Run the installer, enter the organization ID (in lowercase), and reboot.
5. After reboot, sign in to the agent via system tray prompts.

> **Tip:** The organization ID is the first part of your dashboard URL.

### Configure Settings
1. Go to Settings > User Roles > Add new user role and configure as needed.
2. Add users to the role and set global policies under Settings > Global Policies.

### Testing FenixPyre
1. Create a test folder with files in File Explorer.
