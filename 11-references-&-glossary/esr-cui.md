## Why it matters
ESR-CUI provides advanced cybersecurity standards to protect sensitive unclassified data, helping organizations meet federal requirements and bolster defenses.

ESR-CUI refers to a set of stringent requirements outlined in NIST SP 800-171B, focusing on areas like access control and incident response for especially sensitive CUI.

Organizations handling CUI must comply to maintain federal contracts, often verified through third-party assessments.

> **Tip:** Review NIST guidelines for full implementation details.
