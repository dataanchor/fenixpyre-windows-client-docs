## Why it Matters
CMMC helps organizations protect sensitive data, aligning with FenixPyre's encryption capabilities to meet DoD requirements.

CMMC stands for "Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification," a framework by the U.S. Department of Defense to safeguard controlled unclassified information.

It includes three levels:
- Level 1: Foundational protection.
- Level 2: Advanced protection.
- Level 3: Expert protection.

Organizations must maintain certified practices to comply.

> **Warning:** Non-compliance can lead to risks in handling sensitive data.
