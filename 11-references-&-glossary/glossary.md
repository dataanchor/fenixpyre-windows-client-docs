## Why it matters
Understanding PHI is crucial for complying with regulations like HIPAA, ensuring sensitive health data is protected from breaches.

### Protected Health Information (PHI)
PHI stands for Protected Health Information. It refers to any information about an individual's health or healthcare that is created, collected, or maintained by a covered entity under HIPAA. This includes medical records, diagnoses, treatment plans, and insurance details.

PHI must be safeguarded using administrative, technical, and physical measures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As highly sensitive data, it can be targeted for identity theft or financial gain, making encryption tools like FenixPyre essential.
