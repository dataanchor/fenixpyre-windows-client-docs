## Why it Matters
DLP helps organizations safeguard sensitive information from accidental or malicious exposure, reducing risks in data handling.

DLP stands for "Data Loss Prevention." It is a security technology designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or proprietary information.

DLP systems identify sensitive data and monitor access, blocking unauthorized transmissions and alerting administrators.

However, DLP has limitations, including complexity, false positives, potential for evasion, and high costs.
