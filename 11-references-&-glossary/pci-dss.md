# What is PCI DSS?

An explanation of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and its requirements for protecting credit card data.


## Why it Matters
PCI DSS compliance is crucial for organizations handling credit card data to prevent fraud and ensure secure transactions.

PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards for companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information.

Developed by major card brands like Visa and Mastercard, it covers six key categories:
1. Build and maintain a secure network.
2. Protect cardholder data.
3. Maintain a vulnerability management program.
4. Implement strong access control measures.
5. Regularly monitor and test networks.
6. Maintain an information security policy.

Non-compliance can lead to fines and loss of payment processing capabilities.
