## Why it matters
AAA protocols are essential for secure access control in FenixPyre, ensuring only authorized users can encrypt, decrypt, and manage data.

In cybersecurity, AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting:

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user, device, or system.
- **Authorization:** Grants or denies access based on authenticated identity.
- **Accounting:** Tracks and records user activities for auditing.

These are used with other measures like firewalls to protect against threats.
