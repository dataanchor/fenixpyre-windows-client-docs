## Why it matters
BEC attacks exploit email systems to steal sensitive information or funds, making it essential for organizations to implement strong protective measures like encryption and user education.

A BEC attack, or Business Email Compromise, is a cyber threat where attackers unauthorizedly use a company's email to send fraudulent messages or request sensitive data. These attacks often target financial entities and are executed by organized groups.

BEC attacks typically involve compromising a legitimate email account via phishing and impersonating trusted parties to deceive recipients. They are challenging to detect due to their use of real accounts and plausible messages, potentially leading to financial losses and reputational damage.

To defend against BEC attacks, organizations should adopt robust email security, train employees on phishing risks, and monitor for suspicious requests.
