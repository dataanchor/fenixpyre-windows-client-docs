# Why it matters

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple verification methods, protecting FenixPyre accounts from unauthorized access.

## Overview

MFA uses factors like passwords, tokens, or biometrics to confirm user identity, making it more secure than single-factor authentication.

> **Tip:** Enable MFA in your FenixPyre settings for better account protection.
