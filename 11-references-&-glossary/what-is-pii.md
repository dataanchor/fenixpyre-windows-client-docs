# What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?

## Why it Matters
Protecting PII is crucial for preventing identity theft and complying with regulations, ensuring sensitive data remains secure when using FenixPyre for encryption.

PII stands for "Personally Identifiable Information." It is any information that can identify an individual, either alone or when combined with other data. Examples include an individual's name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number, financial account details, and medical records.

PII is a common target for cyberattacks, as it can be exploited for financial gain or identity theft. Therefore, individuals and organizations must safeguard it and be cautious when sharing it online or with third parties.

In the United States, laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) govern the handling of PII to mitigate risks.
