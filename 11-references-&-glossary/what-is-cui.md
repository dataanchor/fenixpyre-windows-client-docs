## Why it matters
Understanding CUI helps organizations protect sensitive unclassified data from cyber threats, aligning with FenixPyre's encryption capabilities.

CUI stands for Controlled Unclassified Information. It refers to sensitive but unclassified data handled by the US government, including personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, and research data.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides guidelines for handling CUI to mitigate cyber risks.
