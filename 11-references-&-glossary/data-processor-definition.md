## Why it matters
Understanding data processors helps ensure compliance with privacy laws when using FenixPyre for data encryption.

A data processor is an individual or organization that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller, as defined in regulations like GDPR. They must follow instructions from the data controller and implement security measures to protect data.

Data processors differ from data controllers, who determine how and why data is processed.
