## Why it Matters
CASBs provide essential security for cloud interactions, helping organizations enforce policies and mitigate risks.

### Understanding CASB
A CASB, or Cloud Access Security Broker, is security software that protects organizational data and systems during cloud access.

It sits between users and cloud applications, monitoring activity, enforcing access controls, and detecting threats for SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS services.
