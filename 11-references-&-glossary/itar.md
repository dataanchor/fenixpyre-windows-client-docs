## Why it matters
ITAR regulations help protect national security by controlling the export of defense-related items, ensuring that FenixPyre's encryption aligns with compliance needs for sensitive data.

ITAR stands for "International Traffic in Arms Regulations." It is a set of regulations in the United States that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List (USML). The ITAR is administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) within the United States Department of State.

The ITAR applies to a wide range of defense-related items and services, including weapons, military equipment, technical data, and defense services. The ITAR requires that individuals and organizations obtain a license or other approval from the DDTC before exporting or importing items or services on the USML. The ITAR also requires that individuals and organizations that engage in the export or import of defense-related items and services register with the DDTC.

The goal of the ITAR is to control the export and import of defense-related items and services in order to protect national security and foreign policy interests. The ITAR is designed to ensure that these items and services are only provided to authorized recipients, and to prevent their proliferation to countries or organizations that may pose a threat to the United States. Violations of the ITAR can result in criminal and civil penalties.
