## Why it matters
HIPAA ensures the privacy and security of protected health information, helping organizations like those using FenixPyre maintain compliance and avoid penalties.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law in the United States that safeguards the privacy of individuals' health information. It applies to covered entities, such as healthcare providers and insurance companies, that handle protected health information (PHI).

HIPAA mandates several requirements:
- Implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
- Develop policies for the appropriate use and disclosure of PHI.
- Grant individuals access to their own PHI upon request.

Violations of HIPAA can lead to civil or criminal penalties, depending on the severity.
