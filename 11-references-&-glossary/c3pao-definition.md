## Why it Matters
Understanding C3PAOs helps organizations comply with federal cybersecurity standards through accredited assessments.

A C3PAO is a "Cybersecurity Continuous Monitoring Third-Party Assessment Organization," accredited by CISA to evaluate an organization's cybersecurity posture and issue reports.

This supports initiatives like the CCM program, promoting ongoing monitoring for federal agencies and contractors.

> **Note:** C3PAOs must adhere to established standards for accurate assessments.
