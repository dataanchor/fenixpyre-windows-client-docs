## Why it matters
FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms ensure that encryption methods meet rigorous U.S. government standards, providing reliable protection for sensitive data in FenixPyre.

FIPS 140-2, developed by NIST, sets requirements for cryptographic modules. A validated algorithm has been independently tested and approved for security and reliability.

These algorithms are essential for applications in secure communications, data protection, and authentication, commonly used in government, finance, and healthcare sectors.

> **Note:** Validation offers assurance of an algorithm's robustness, making it a key consideration for compliance.
