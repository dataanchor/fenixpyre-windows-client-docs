## Why it matters
Asymmetrical encryption enables secure data exchange without sharing secret keys, enhancing FenixPyre's encryption capabilities.

### Understanding Asymmetrical Encryption
Asymmetrical encryption uses a public key for encrypting data and a private key for decrypting it. This method ensures secure communication over networks.

Examples include RSA, DSA, and ECC algorithms.

> **Tip:** Always keep the private key secure to maintain encryption integrity.
