## Why it matters
NIST SP 800-172 provides advanced cybersecurity requirements, helping FenixPyre users protect sensitive data beyond basic standards.

NIST SP 800-172 extends NIST SP 800-171 with enhanced requirements for protecting controlled unclassified information (CUI). It covers areas like access control, incident response, and system protection.

Organizations handling CUI must comply, often through third-party assessments, to meet federal standards.

> **Warning:** Non-compliance can lead to security risks; integrate these guidelines with FenixPyre practices.
