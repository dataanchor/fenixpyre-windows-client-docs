# What is Zero Trust?

Understand the zero trust security model and its role in modern encryption practices, ensuring no implicit trust in any user or device.


## Why it matters
Zero trust enhances security by verifying every access request, reducing risks in an era where insider threats and external breaches are common.

Zero trust is a security concept that calls for organizations to abandon the traditional model of security, where access to resources is granted based on assumptions of trust. Instead, it assumes all users and devices are untrusted and must be verified before accessing resources.

The goal is to minimize the attack surface by limiting access to only what's necessary, using strong authentication, network segmentation, and other controls to protect against threats like malware and data breaches.
