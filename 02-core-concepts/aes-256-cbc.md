# What is AES-256-CBC?

An overview of AES-256-CBC encryption, a key component of FenixPyre's security model for protecting sensitive data.


## Why it matters
AES-256-CBC provides robust symmetric encryption for FenixPyre, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity against unauthorized access.

AES-256-CBC stands for "Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Cipher Block Chaining mode." It is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 256-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data.

AES is a secure standard developed by NIST and approved for various applications. The 256-bit key size offers strong protection due to the vast number of possible combinations.

In CBC mode, each data block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, preventing patterns in the plaintext from appearing in the ciphertext.

> **Tip:** AES-256-CBC is ideal for encrypting sensitive information like financial data or personal files.
