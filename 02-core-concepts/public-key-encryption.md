Why it matters: Public key encryption enables secure data exchange in FenixPyre, ensuring that only authorized users can decrypt sensitive information.

## What is Public Key Encryption?
Public key encryption, or asymmetric encryption, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encrypting data and a private key for decrypting it.

- The public key can be shared openly.
- The private key must remain secure.

Examples of algorithms include RSA, DSA, and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

> **Note:** This method is crucial for secure internet communications, allowing encrypted messages without prior key exchange.

## How FenixPyre Uses It
In FenixPyre, public key encryption supports key management and secure sharing.
