# What is Per-File Encryption?

Understand per-file encryption and its role in FenixPyre for securing individual files against unauthorized access (under 160 characters).


Why it matters: Per-file encryption protects sensitive data at the file level, ensuring that even if a device is compromised, individual files remain secure.

Per-file encryption encodes specific files or folders using encryption algorithms to safeguard data. It prevents unauthorized access to items like documents or images, even if the storage device is lost.

This method uses an encryption key and can be combined with other security measures like passwords. It's often preferred over full disk encryption for targeted protection.
