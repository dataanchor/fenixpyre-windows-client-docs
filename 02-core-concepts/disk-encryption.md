## Why it matters
Disk encryption safeguards sensitive data on storage devices, protecting against unauthorized access even if the device is compromised.

Disk encryption is a security measure that involves encoding data on a disk or disk partition using encryption algorithms. It protects the entire disk, including the operating system, applications, and user data.

There are two main types: full disk encryption, which encrypts everything, and file/folder encryption, which targets specific items. FenixPyre integrates these for enhanced security.
