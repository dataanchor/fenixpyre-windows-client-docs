## Why It Matters
Extortionware not only encrypts data but also threatens to expose it publicly, amplifying reputational and compliance risks.

### Understanding Extortionware
Extortionware is ransomware that threatens to release sensitive information (e.g., personal data, financial details) unless a ransom is paid.

Key aspects:
- Involves "doxing" to damage reputations.
- Targets individuals and organizations for maximum impact.

> **Tip:** Implement zero-trust policies in FenixPyre to prevent such exposures.
