# Allow Processes to Open Encrypted Files in Non-Protected Folders

Override default settings to access encrypted files outside protected folders in FenixPyre.


## Why it matters
This feature enables seamless workflow by allowing authorized processes to access encrypted files anywhere, enhancing usability without compromising security.

By default, FenixPyre only allows opening encrypted files in protected folders configured in the admin dashboard or locally. For files encrypted by Protect-by-Process applications, you can override this.

### How to Allow a Process
1. Add the process as a Protect-by-Process application.
2. Check the option to allow it in non-protected folders.
