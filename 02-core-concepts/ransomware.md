## Why It Matters
Ransomware attacks can encrypt critical data, leading to data loss and financial demands, making proactive encryption essential.

### Understanding Ransomware
Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts a victim's files. Attackers demand payment to restore access, often via disguised files like Trojans.

Key risks include:
- Loss of sensitive data.
- Potential for extortion.

> **Note:** Always maintain backups and use encryption tools like FenixPyre to mitigate risks.
