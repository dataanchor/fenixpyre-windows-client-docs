## Why it Matters
Data-centric security prioritizes the protection of data at its core, ensuring it remains secure regardless of where it's stored or transmitted, which is vital in modern cloud-based environments.

Data-centric security is an approach that emphasizes protecting the data itself rather than just the systems or networks. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability through methods like encryption and access controls.

> **Note:** This model is particularly useful for data in the cloud, accessed from various devices.
