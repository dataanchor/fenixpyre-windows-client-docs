## Why it Matters
Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security, protecting accounts from unauthorized access and reducing the impact of compromised credentials.

2FA is a multi-factor authentication method using two verification factors, such as a password and a mobile device, to confirm user identity and prevent cyber threats.

> **Note:** It's widely used in online services for better protection.
